# can_crusher_demo_cad_models
A CAD model that will represent the physical design and layout of a can crusher made for school demo's of PLC application and operation.

This project is for a Programmable Logic Controller Class, to demonstrate understanding and proficiency in using PLC's for a specific goal. 
In addition to demonstrating knowledge of PLC's this project will be used as a demo at STEM related events to demonstrate how PLC's 
work with visual aid and how they can be quickly and easily adapted to simple industrial application.
